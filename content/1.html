					<p>One of the things that people always misunderstand is<br />Sadness only have bad aspects.<br />But the truth is, sadness doesn’t have any less importance than happiness.<br />“Why?” you may ask. “Doesn’t sadness always lead to everything that is bad?”<br />Let me explain it to you…</center></p>
					<p><br /><h4><b>Happiness</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness (or joy) is one of the basic emotion. It is the first emotion that develops inside ourselves. But when we started to grow up, happiness started to fade away from our life. That’s why people always talk that they want more happiness.<br />Happiness appeared when someone achieved something that he/she want. For example, you can get happy if you get a medal about something. Happiness is important to us. It makes us have a reason to live in this world and drive us to do better in every day. If we don’t have any happiness, we will lose reason to live. Sadness and stress will overwhelm you and they can leads to psychological problems and in the worst case, may leads to suicide.<br /><br />So then, doesn’t it better to don’t have any sadness coming to someone’s life?<br />No. Because Sadness is the thing which is important to create happiness.</p>
					<p><br /><h4><b>Sadness</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadness is an opposite emotion of happiness. Sadness create from bad situations such as when you need something but didn’t get it. For example, you can be leaded to sadness if you broke up with your girl/boyfriend that you love very much.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that sadness is the thing that people don’t want to receive.</p>
					<p><br />But what people don’t see is sadness have a lot of good things too.<br />If we never fail the test, we won’t know how relieved we feel when we passed the test.<br />If we never lose to someone, we won’t know how great it is when we win.<br />If we never broke up, we won’t know the important of having someone by your side<br />If we don’t have sadness, we won’t know what happiness is.<br />And that is why sadness is very important.<br />Sadness is the bound that make us realize what happiness is.<br />Sadness is the thing that make us happy.<br />Sadness is what we must have<br /><h5><b>Because sadness create happiness.</b></h5>And that is important because happiness is what we all want.<br /><br /><h5><b>Moreover, sadness taught us about what we have done wrong.</b></h5><br />When you sad about something, you will have more time to think about the problem.<br />When you sad about loss of your relation, you will think more about them.<br />When you failed in a test, you will have time to think that now you are not good enough and prepare for the next test.<br />When your girl/boyfriends leave you, you will have more time to think what did you do it wrong and develop yourself.<br /><h5><b>For the last, sadness is a way to make us stronger.</b></h5>Do you notice that after you leave your sadness, you will get stronger and well prepared for the next problem that you are going to face?<br /><br />That what sadness does to us.<br /><b>It makes us stronger, creates happiness and teaches us.</b></p>
