					<p><center>It is normal to feel sad. Actually, it is hard to not feel sad once in a lifetime.<br />Even though <a href="1.html">sadness doesn’t have only bad aspects</a>, it is still should be vanished as fast as possible.<br />It is okay to feel sad, but sadness is not the thing that should last long.<br />So how to delete it? How to make it disappeared?<br />Here are 3 easy ways to stop and escape from sadness.</center></p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, <b>cry</b>. It is not ashamed to cry when you feel sad. Moreover, it is better to release your feeling more than keep it on your own. But you shouldn’t crying 3 full days without end. You should know where to stop crying (or in the other word, where do you feel better) and start to continue your own life.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, <b>distraction</b>. Distract yourself from the problem that you feel sad by any means possible. Food, games, friends, sleeping, whatever that make you don’t think about the problem that you faced. You may think that running away from problems isn’t good, but problems can be solved better when there are no emotion on it.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last one, most important, <b>changes of thought</b>. If you still think that you cannot escape from this situation, you won’t get out of the situation. Thinking that this must be end someday can help you a lot. Because a 1000-mile journey started with a single step. And escape from sadness started with a thought that “I will escape from this.”</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are 3 easy ways to get out of being sad. Cry, distraction and changes of thought are the ways to do it. But most importantly, don’t let your sadness from this time to go waste. Think and learn more about it, and not let it happens again.</p>
